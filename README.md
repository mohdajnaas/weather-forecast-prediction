# Project Title: Weather Prediction using Machine Learning

# Project Description:

The Weather Prediction using Machine Learning project is a comprehensive initiative that harnesses the power of machine learning algorithms to forecast weather conditions. By leveraging historical weather data, this project aims to build a predictive model capable of providing accurate and timely predictions for various meteorological parameters. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization, offering a valuable tool for meteorologists, researchers, and weather enthusiasts.

# Key Features:

1. Dataset Acquisition: Utilize historical weather datasets from reliable sources, encompassing a diverse range of meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The dataset should cover a significant time span to facilitate effective model training.

2. Data Preprocessing: Perform thorough data cleaning, handle missing values, and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for machine learning model training. Feature engineering may be employed to extract relevant information and enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.

3. Machine Learning Model Selection: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms suitable for time-series prediction, such as decision trees, random forests, or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The choice of the model may depend on the specific characteristics of the weather data.

4. Training and Validation: Split the dataset into training and validation sets to train the machine learning model. Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure robust model performance and prevent overfitting.

5. Evaluation Metrics: Assess the accuracy and reliability of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients. These metrics provide insights into the model's predictive performance.

6. Real-time Prediction: Implement a system for real-time weather prediction, allowing users to input current meteorological conditions and receive forecasts based on the trained machine learning model.

7. Visualization: Create visualizations, such as time-series plots or graphs, to showcase the model's predictions compared to actual weather data. Visualization tools enhance the interpretability of the predictions and facilitate a better understanding of the model's performance.

# Dependencies:

The project relies on Python programming language and popular libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for machine learning, and Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization
